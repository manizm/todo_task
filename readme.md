## Task - Todo App
This app will use:
* MEAN stack
  * MongoDB
  * Express 
  * Angular 1x
  * Node
* Webpack. 
* passport.js _(for user authentication)_
* _(maybe)_ bcrypt _(for password hashing)_ 
* socket.io _(for realtime changes)_

### Todo.md
I will be making a todo.md file (checklist file - how ironical Mani!) where you can check the development process and what I have completed so far. **Please check help folder**

### File Structure
Please refer to `file.structure.md` file on the root folder

### Suggestions
If you have any suggestions, feel free to shout it out!

### Installation
##### Requirements: _Node v6.11.1+, npm version 3.10.10+_

1. `npm install`

2. **Optional** you might need to run production command at least once to create dist folder `npm run prod`

3. **For static dev server** `npm run dev`

4. **For dev server using express** `SET DEBUG=todo-task:* & npm start`

_I would recommend using 3rd command instead of 2nd. Besides, both of them use hot module replacement_
