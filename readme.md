## Task - Todo App
This app will use:
* MEAN stack
  * MongoDB
  * Express 
  * Angular 1x
  * Node
* Webpack. 
* passport.js _(for user authentication)_
* _(maybe)_ bcrypt _(for password hashing)_ 
* socket.io _(for realtime changes)_

### Todo.md
I will be making a todo.md file (checklist file - how ironical Mani!) where you can check the development process and what I have completed so far

### Suggestions
If you have any suggestions, feel free to shout it out!
